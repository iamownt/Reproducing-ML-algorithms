# some summary of the algorithms.
1. KNN: the important part is the distance matrix. using the matrix operation without loops is fastest!
2. ID3: entropy and InfoGain methods, recursive tree creation. In fact the code structure is not good and not easy to prune.
3. C4.5: change the InfoGain methods to InfoGainRatio.
4. CART: good code structure.
